# Shifted Hamming Distance

Shifted Hamming Distance (SHD) is an edit-distance based filter that can quickly check whether the
minimum number of edits (including insertions, deletions and substitutions) between two strings is
smaller than a user defined threshold **T** (the number of allowed edits between the two strings).
