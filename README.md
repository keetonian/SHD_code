TODO:
Modify SHD for our algorithms
1. Modify SHD for the 4-bit encoding algorithm that uses an error threshold at math.pow(2, log2(read_size)-1). In this case, a larger number means more accuracy, whereas the traditional SHD algorithm has a lower number mean greater accuracy.
2. Modify SHD for the 16-bit encoding algorithm.
